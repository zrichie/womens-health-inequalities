# Candidate follow-on questions

This file captures questions generated by the high-level overview of women’s health
inequalities. These questions are intended to guide deeper, focused analyses within
this portfolio.

They are **hypotheses and investigation prompts**, not conclusions. Inclusion here
does not imply causality or policy recommendation.

Questions may be refined, deprioritised, or discarded as analyses progress.

## 1. Underdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis

Observed patterns in administrative and prescribing data may suggest underdiagnosis
or delayed diagnosis of conditions that disproportionately affect women.

Candidate questions include:
- Do diagnosed prevalence patterns align with expected burden across age groups?
- Are there systematic differences in diagnosis rates by socioeconomic deprivation?
- Do women in more deprived areas present later or with more severe outcomes?
- Are emergency admissions higher in groups with lower recorded diagnosis prevalence?

These questions may be explored using triangulation across diagnoses, admissions, and
prescribing patterns.

## 2. Access to care versus severity at presentation

Differences in service use may reflect barriers to access rather than differences in
underlying need.

Candidate questions include:
- Are women in certain age or deprivation groups more likely to access care via
  emergency routes?
- Is there evidence of higher-intensity care following delayed access?
- Do prescribing patterns differ between emergency and elective care pathways?

These questions focus on **system interaction**, not individual behaviour.

## 3. Treatment patterns and primary care management

Prescribing data provide insight into how women’s health issues are managed in
primary care, but may also reveal gaps in care.

Candidate questions include:
- Are treatments initiated later or less frequently in more deprived populations?
- Do prescribing rates vary independently of recorded diagnosis prevalence?
- Are certain symptoms more likely to be treated pharmacologically without
  corresponding diagnostic recording?

These analyses will treat prescribing as a proxy for clinical action rather than
unmet need.

## 4. Pain management and symptom-focused treatment

Differences in pain-related prescribing and service use may reflect variation in how
women’s symptoms are recognised and managed.

Candidate questions include:
- Are women more likely to receive repeated analgesic prescriptions without
  diagnostic escalation?
- Are there deprivation gradients in pain-related prescribing?
- Do patterns differ by life stage (e.g. reproductive years, peri-menopause)?

Interpretation will be cautious and avoid assumptions about appropriateness.

---

## 5. Mental health treatment as a proxy for distress

Mental health prescribing may sometimes reflect distress arising from untreated or
poorly managed physical health conditions.

Candidate questions include:
- Are increases in mental health prescribing temporally aligned with reproductive
  or menopausal life stages?
- Do deprivation gradients differ between mental health treatment and physical
  diagnosis?
- Is mental health treatment more common where physical diagnoses are sparse?

These questions will be framed as hypotheses, not causal claims.

---

## 6. Life-course patterns and transition points

Women’s health risks and healthcare interactions change substantially across the
life course.

Candidate questions include:
- Are there specific age ranges where inequalities widen or narrow?
- Do transitions (e.g. adolescence, midlife, older age) correspond to changes in
  access or treatment patterns?
- Are menopause-related patterns visible indirectly through prescribing or service
  use?

These analyses aim to identify **critical periods** for further investigation.

---

## 7. Measurement gaps and data quality

Absence or inconsistency in observed patterns may reflect limitations in available
data rather than true absence of inequality.

Candidate questions include:
- Which outcomes are consistently under-recorded across datasets?
- Where do different data sources disagree?
- Which inequalities are most sensitive to data source or method choice?

These questions may motivate methodological or bias-focused projects.

---

## 8. Prioritisation for follow-on projects

Not all questions listed above will be pursued.

Prioritisation will consider:
- strength and consistency of observed patterns
- potential for meaningful insight using public data
- risk of misinterpretation or overclaiming
- relevance to women’s health inequalities

Selected questions will be developed into focused analyses under:
- `02-condition-specific-analyses/`
- `03-healthcare-experience-and-access/`
- `04-methods-and-bias/`

### Status

This document will be updated iteratively as the overview analysis progresses and as
new patterns emerge.
