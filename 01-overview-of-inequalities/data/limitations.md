# Data limitations and analytical considerations

This project relies on publicly available administrative and survey data to explore
women’s health inequalities at a population level. While these sources allow broad
comparison across age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation, they have important and
well-documented limitations.

These limitations are not treated as residual noise, but as analytical findings that
shape interpretation and motivate follow-on work.

## 1. Underdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis

Many conditions that disproportionately affect women (e.g. endometriosis, PCOS,
menopause-related symptoms) are known to be underdiagnosed, diagnosed late, or
inconsistently recorded across healthcare settings.

As a result:
- recorded prevalence is likely to underestimate true burden
- differences in diagnosis rates may reflect access, awareness, or clinical behaviour
  rather than underlying incidence
- absence of a signal in administrative data does not imply absence of harm

Analyses based on diagnoses or coded conditions are therefore interpreted cautiously
and primarily as indicators of health system interaction, not true disease prevalence.

## 2. Prescribing as a proxy for care

Primary care prescribing data are used in this project as a proxy for treatment and
management, particularly where diagnosis data are incomplete or unavailable.

However:
- prescribing does not equate to diagnosis
- absence of prescribing does not imply absence of symptoms or need
- prescribing patterns reflect clinician behaviour, guidelines, and service capacity
  as well as patient need
- secondary care prescribing is not fully captured in public datasets

Prescribing data are therefore interpreted as reflecting observable clinical action,
not unmet need or quality of care.

## 3. Limited visibility of lived experience

Public datasets provide little direct insight into:
- pain severity or duration
- symptom burden
- quality of life
- experiences of disbelief or dismissal in healthcare

The GP Patient Survey provides some insight into patient experience but is:
- self-reported
- not condition-specific
- subject to response bias

As a result, many aspects of women’s health inequality remain structurally
under-measured, even where outcomes appear similar.

## 4. Administrative coding and measurement bias

Administrative health data are shaped by coding practices, incentive structures, and
service organisation.

This introduces potential biases, including:
- differential recording by condition or population group
- variation in coding completeness across regions and services
- misclassification of symptoms into broader diagnostic categories

These factors may obscure or distort true inequality patterns and are considered when
interpreting observed differences.

---

## 5. Socioeconomic deprivation as a proxy

Socioeconomic deprivation (e.g. IMD) is used as a proxy for structural disadvantage.
While widely used and policy-relevant, it:
- operates at an area level rather than individual level
- may mask within-area heterogeneity
- does not capture all dimensions of inequality

Observed deprivation gradients are therefore interpreted as structural signals, not
individual-level effects.

---

## 6. Intersectionality and data availability

Public datasets often limit the ability to explore intersectional inequalities,
particularly across ethnicity, disability, migration status, and gender identity.

Where possible, these dimensions may be explored in follow-on work, but they are not
comprehensively addressed in this overview due to data quality and interpretability
constraints.

---

## 7. Descriptive, not causal, interpretation

All analyses in this project are descriptive and comparative.

They do not:
- estimate causal effects
- attribute responsibility to individuals or services
- imply effectiveness or ineffectiveness of specific interventions

Observed associations are used to generate hypotheses and prioritise questions, not to
draw causal conclusions.

---

## 8. Why these limitations matter

The limitations described above reflect broader structural issues in how women’s
health is researched, recorded, and prioritised.

Recognising and documenting these gaps is necessary for:
- responsible interpretation of observed inequalities
- avoiding false reassurance where data are sparse
- identifying where improved data collection or methods are needed

---

## Role of limitations in this portfolio

These limitations directly inform:
- the choice of analytical methods
- interpretation of results
- identification of follow-on projects in `next-questions.md`
- methodological and bias-focused analyses elsewhere in the portfolio

They are treated as core analytical context, not an afterthought.
