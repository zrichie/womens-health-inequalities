# Overview of Women’s Health Inequalities

## Purpose

This project provides a **high-level, descriptive overview of health
inequalities affecting women**, using publicly available UK data.

The purpose is not to make causal claims or definitive explanations, but to:
- quantify the scale and distribution of inequalities
- examine how outcomes, access to care, and treatment patterns vary by
  age and socioeconomic deprivation
- identify where patterns are consistent, uncertain, or poorly measured
- generate **priority questions** for deeper, focused analysis

This project forms the foundation of the wider portfolio.

## Scope and framing

This analysis is intentionally **broad rather than deep**.

It focuses on:
- population-level patterns
- descriptive and comparative statistics
- transparency around uncertainty and data limitations
- triangulation across multiple data sources

It does **not** attempt to:
- infer causality
- evaluate individual clinical decision-making
- directly observe GP consultations or diagnostic encounters
- provide clinical or policy recommendations

---

## Observing primary care in public data

Primary care activity is **not directly observable** in public datasets.
This project therefore uses **proxies**, including:
- primary care prescribing patterns
- patient-reported experience of GP services
- downstream service use (e.g. emergency admissions)

These proxies are interpreted cautiously and used to understand **system-level
patterns**, not individual care quality.

---

## Data sources

All analyses use **publicly available UK datasets only**, including:
- Office for National Statistics (ONS)
- NHS England / NHS Digital published statistics
- NHS Business Services Authority prescribing data
- GP Patient Survey
- Fingertips public profiles
- Census 2021 population denominators

Full details and caveats are provided in `data/sources.md`.

---

## Analytical approach

Planned analyses prioritise:
- clear definition of populations and denominators
- age- and deprivation-stratified comparisons
- use of rates and rate ratios where appropriate
- explicit discussion of bias and data gaps
- interpretability over technical complexity

---

## Key limitations

Well-documented challenges in women’s health data affect this work, including:
- underdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of gendered conditions
- prescribing as an imperfect proxy for care
- limited capture of pain, symptoms, and quality of life
- incentive-driven recording in some datasets

These limitations are treated as **analytical findings**, not residual noise.

---

## Outputs

This project produces:
- descriptive tables and figures
- inequality comparisons by age and deprivation
- documented analytical decisions
- a set of follow-on questions captured in `next-questions.md`

All outputs are fully reproducible from the analysis scripts.

## Status

🟡 In progress  
Analyses are added iteratively as data are explored and refined.
