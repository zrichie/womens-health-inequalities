title: "Descriptive landscape of women’s health inequalities"
output: html_document

## Purpose

This analysis provides a high-level, descriptive overview of women’s health
inequalities using publicly available UK health data.

The aim is to establish the broad landscape of outcomes and healthcare
utilisation affecting women, and to identify patterns that warrant deeper,
focused analysis in subsequent work.

This analysis is descriptive in nature and does not attempt causal inference.

---
## Scope and framing

This analysis focuses on women as the primary population of interest.
Variation within women by age and over time is explored to understand how
healthcare utilisation and serious morbidity change across the life course.

Limited comparisons with men may be used for high-level contextual purposes
only. Men are not treated as a parallel analytic population, and sex
comparisons are not a primary focus of this work.

### Time period and pandemic context

Analyses focus on a recent five-year period to balance recency with stability of
patterns. This period includes the COVID-19 pandemic, which substantially affected
hospital activity.

Results are interpreted descriptively, with particular caution around absolute
levels during pandemic-affected years. The focus is on identifying persistent
patterns and gradients rather than attributing changes to specific causes.

## Outcomes included

Planned outcome domains include:
- all-cause hospital admissions
- primary care prescribing (as a proxy for treatment and management)
- screening or preventive care indicators (where available)

Mortality is used for contextual purposes only and is not a focal outcome in
this analysis.

### Primary care prescribing domains

Prescribing data are used as a proxy for observable primary care clinical
action. To maintain interpretability and avoid over-fragmentation, prescribing
analyses in this overview are limited to the following broad functional domains:

- **Hormonal symptom management**  
  (including menopausal hormone therapy and related treatments used to manage
  hormonally mediated symptoms across the life course)

- **Analgesics**  
  (used as a proxy for pain and symptom management)

- **Antidepressants (SSRIs)**  
  (used as a proxy for mental health treatment and distress)

These domains are intended to surface broad patterns rather than to evaluate
appropriateness of prescribing or infer diagnosis.

## Stratification variables

All analyses will be stratified where possible by:
- sex
- age group
- socioeconomic deprivation (e.g. IMD)

Additional stratifiers may be explored cautiously.

### Age grouping (life-course bands)

Analyses are presented using life-course age bands chosen to align with key stages
in women’s health and to support comparability across outcomes:

- 0–14
- 15–24
- 25–44
- 45–54
- 55–64
- 65–74
- 75+

Where source datasets use different age bands, results will be mapped to the nearest
life-course grouping where feasible and any deviations will be documented.

### Socioeconomic deprivation

Socioeconomic deprivation is measured using an area-based index (e.g. Index of
Multiple Deprivation, IMD), grouped into quintiles from most deprived (Q1) to least
deprived (Q5).

Quintiles are used to balance interpretability, statistical stability, and
comparability across datasets. Where source data use alternative groupings, results
will be mapped to IMD quintiles where feasible and any deviations will be documented.

## Data sources and period

Hospital admissions analyses use publicly available, aggregated Hospital Episode
Statistics (HES) data published by NHS England.

The primary focus is on all-cause inpatient admissions, with emergency and
elective admissions considered separately where available. Data are aggregated
and non-identifiable, and are used to describe patterns of healthcare utilisation
rather than individual patient pathways.

Analyses focus on a recent five-year period to balance recency with stability of
observed patterns. This period includes the COVID-19 pandemic, which
substantially affected hospital activity and service delivery.

Results are interpreted descriptively, with particular caution around absolute
levels during pandemic-affected years. The emphasis is on identifying persistent
patterns across age groups and over time, rather than attributing changes to
specific causes.

```{r setup-admissions, eval = FALSE}
# This chunk defines the expected structure and scope of the hospital
# admissions data used in this analysis.
#
# At this stage, no data are loaded. The purpose of this chunk is to:
# - document assumptions about the published HES tables
# - clarify key variables required for analysis
# - provide a stable entry point for subsequent data loading

# Expected variables in admissions dataset:
# - year: reporting year (financial or calendar, dataset-specific)
# - sex: sex of patient (analysis will focus on females)
# - age_group: age band as published or mapped to life-course groups
# - imd_quintile: area-level deprivation quintile (Q1 most deprived – Q5 least deprived)
# - admission_type: emergency or elective admission
# - admissions: count of admissions (aggregate, non-identifiable)

# Analytical intent:
# - filter to women as the primary population of interest
# - summarise admissions by age group and admission type
# - use this structure to support descriptive comparisons over time
#
# Data loading and transformation will be added in subsequent steps.

## Analytical approach

Planned analyses include:
- descriptive summaries
- rates and rate ratios where denominators are available
- clear presentation of uncertainty
- explicit discussion of data limitations

Methods will prioritise interpretability and appropriateness over complexity.

### Exploratory questions (admissions)

This analysis will explore the following high-level questions to orient the
descriptive landscape:

- How do all-cause hospital admission rates vary across age groups for women?
- How does the balance between emergency and elective admissions change across
  the life course?
- Are there age ranges where emergency admissions dominate more strongly?
- Do observed patterns appear stable enough to support stratification by
  socioeconomic deprivation in subsequent analyses?

These questions are intended to establish baseline patterns rather than to draw
explanatory conclusions.

## Limitations and next steps

Key data limitations and analytical considerations are documented in
`data/limitations.md`.

Patterns identified in this overview will be used to prioritise focused analyses,
including inequality analyses by deprivation and condition-specific follow-on
work.
