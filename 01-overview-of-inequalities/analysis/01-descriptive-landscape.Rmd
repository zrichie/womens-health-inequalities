title: "Descriptive landscape of women’s health inequalities"
output: html_document
---

## Purpose

This analysis provides a high-level descriptive overview of women’s health
inequalities using publicly available UK data.

The aim is to:
- establish baseline patterns by sex, age, and deprivation
- identify where disparities appear largest or most uncertain
- generate focused follow-on questions for deeper analysis

This analysis is descriptive and does not attempt causal inference.

## Outcomes included

Planned outcome domains include:
- mortality (where relevant)
- hospital admissions
- primary care prescribing (as a proxy for treatment and management)
- screening or preventive care indicators (where available)

### Primary care prescribing domains

Prescribing data are used as a proxy for observable primary care clinical action.
To maintain interpretability and avoid over-fragmentation, prescribing analyses
in this overview are limited to the following broad functional domains:

- **Hormonal symptom management**  
  (including menopausal hormone therapy and related treatments used to manage
  hormonally mediated symptoms across the life course)

- **Analgesics**  
  (used as a proxy for pain and symptom management)

- **Antidepressants (SSRIs)**  
  (used as a proxy for mental health treatment and distress)

These domains are intended to surface broad patterns rather than to evaluate
appropriateness of prescribing or infer diagnosis.

## Stratification variables

All analyses will be stratified where possible by:
- sex
- age group
- socioeconomic deprivation (e.g. IMD)

Additional stratifiers may be explored cautiously.

### Age grouping (life-course bands)

Analyses are presented using life-course age bands chosen to align with key stages
in women’s health and to support comparability across outcomes:

- 0–14
- 15–24
- 25–44
- 45–54
- 55–64
- 65–74
- 75+

Where source datasets use different age bands, results will be mapped to the nearest
life-course grouping where feasible and any deviations will be documented.

## Data sources

See `../data/sources.md` for full details of datasets and links.

---

## Analytical approach

Planned analyses include:
- descriptive summaries
- rates and rate ratios where denominators are available
- clear presentation of uncertainty
- explicit discussion of data limitations

Methods will prioritise interpretability and appropriateness over complexity.

---

## Limitations

Key limitations are expected to include:
- underdiagnosis of gendered conditions
- prescribing as an imperfect proxy for care
- incomplete capture of lived experience

These will be discussed explicitly rather than treated as residual noise.

## What this suggests next

This section will be completed after initial descriptive results are produced
and will feed directly into `next-questions.md`.
