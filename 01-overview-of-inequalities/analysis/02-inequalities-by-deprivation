title: "Women’s health inequalities by socioeconomic deprivation"
output: html_document
---

## Purpose

This analysis explores how the broad patterns identified in
`01-descriptive-landscape.Rmd` vary by socioeconomic deprivation.

The aim is to:
- describe gradients in women’s health outcomes and service use by deprivation
- assess whether inequalities are consistent across age groups and outcome domains
- identify where deprivation-related disparities appear strongest or most uncertain

This analysis remains **descriptive** and does not attempt causal inference.

---

## Relationship to the descriptive landscape

This analysis builds directly on the high-level patterns identified in the
descriptive landscape.

Specifically, it asks:
- whether patterns observed overall differ systematically by deprivation
- whether apparent inequalities are consistent across life stages
- whether some outcomes show steeper or flatter deprivation gradients than others

Findings here are used to prioritise follow-on analyses rather than to draw
explanatory conclusions.

---

## Deprivation measure

Socioeconomic deprivation is measured using an area-based index
(e.g. Index of Multiple Deprivation, IMD), grouped into ordered categories
(e.g. quintiles or deciles).

Deprivation is treated as:
- a proxy for structural disadvantage
- a population-level measure, not an individual attribute

Limitations of this approach are discussed explicitly in
`../data/limitations.md`.

## Outcomes included

Planned outcome domains include (subject to data quality and availability):

- mortality (where relevant)
- hospital admissions (e.g. emergency vs elective)
- primary care prescribing (as a proxy for treatment)
- screening or preventive care indicators (where available)

Not all outcomes included in the descriptive landscape will necessarily be
included here.

### Primary care prescribing domains

This analysis focuses on selected prescribing domains where deprivation-related
gradients are likely to be interpretable and relevant to women’s health
inequalities.

The following functional prescribing domains are included:

- **Hormonal symptom management**  
  (including menopausal hormone therapy and related treatments)

- **Analgesics**

- **Antidepressants (SSRIs)**

Prescribing is treated as a proxy for treatment access and management rather than
as a measure of underlying prevalence or unmet need. Interpretation focuses on
system-level patterns rather than individual clinical decisions.


---

## Stratification and comparisons

Analyses will be stratified where possible by:
- age group
- deprivation category

Comparisons will focus on:
- gradients across deprivation categories
- consistency of patterns across age groups
- differences in magnitude between outcome domains

Sex-specific analysis will remain the primary focus.

### Age grouping (life-course bands)

Analyses are presented using life-course age bands chosen to align with key stages
in women’s health and to support comparability across outcomes:

- 0–14
- 15–24
- 25–44
- 45–54
- 55–64
- 65–74
- 75+

Where source datasets use different age bands, results will be mapped to the nearest
life-course grouping where feasible and any deviations will be documented.

---

## Analytical approach

Planned analyses include:
- descriptive summaries by deprivation category
- rates and rate ratios where appropriate denominators are available
- graphical presentation of gradients and uncertainty
- cautious comparison across outcomes rather than formal modelling

Methods are chosen to maximise interpretability and minimise overstatement.

---

## Interpretation and limitations

Observed deprivation gradients may reflect a combination of:
- differences in underlying health need
- differences in access to and experience of care
- differences in recording and measurement

As such:
- gradients are interpreted as **signals of inequality**, not explanations
- absence of a gradient does not imply absence of disadvantage
- comparisons across outcomes are treated cautiously

Key limitations are discussed in `../data/limitations.md`.

---

## What this suggests next

This section will synthesise observed patterns and identify
priority follow-on questions, including:

- outcomes with particularly steep or uneven gradients
- age groups where inequalities appear to widen or narrow
- discrepancies between outcome types (e.g. admissions vs prescribing)

These questions will be captured in `../next-questions.md` and used to guide
subsequent, focused analyses.

## Status

🟡 Planned / in progress  
This analysis will be developed iteratively as data are explored.
