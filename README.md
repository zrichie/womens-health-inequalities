# Women’s Health Inequalities – Data Science Portfolio

This repository is an applied health data science portfolio focused on
understanding and communicating health inequalities affecting women.

The work uses **publicly available UK health data only** and demonstrates:
- framing complex public-health questions
- epidemiological and statistical reasoning
- appropriate use of regression and descriptive methods
- careful handling of bias, uncertainty, and data limitations
- reproducible analytical structure
- clear communication for technical and non-technical audiences

The portfolio is organised as a small, coherent programme of work rather than
disconnected projects.

## How this repository is organised

The repository is structured thematically:

- **01-overview-of-inequalities/**  
  A high-level descriptive overview of women’s health inequalities, used to
  identify priority questions for deeper analysis.

- **02-condition-specific-analyses/**  
  Focused analyses of specific women’s health conditions (e.g. PCOS,
  endometriosis, menopause), developed from patterns identified in the overview.

- **03-healthcare-experience-and-access/**  
  Analyses exploring access to care and experience of healthcare using
  prescribing data, surveys, and service-use proxies.

- **04-methods-and-bias/**  
  Methodological work examining data quality, bias, and limitations in women’s
  health data.

- **05-predictive-and-risk-modelling/**  
  Carefully scoped predictive analyses, with emphasis on validation,
  interpretability, and appropriate use.

- **06-communication-and-advocacy/**  
  Examples of translating technical analysis into clear, decision-relevant
  communication.
